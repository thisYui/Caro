- Feature 2: Simple game logic.

## Requirements
- Operating System: Linux / Windows
- Programming Language: C++20 and Python 3.12.3
- Dependencies: Pygame 2.0.1, CMake 3.30

## Attention
- About C++ you need compile the project to create the .dll file.
- About Python, you need to install the Pygame library to run the project.
- If you can run, check your Python version and Pygame version. Maybe the reason is path error you should check the path of the .dll file and the .png file.

## Operating
- Step 1: Clone the project to your computer.
- Step 2: In the C++ project, you need to compile the project to create the .dll file. In the Python project, you need to install the Pygame library.
- Step 3: When you have completed the above steps, you can run the project in main.py file.
